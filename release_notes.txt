# MovieCart Version 2

Main improvements:

 - Replaced bulky expensive obsolete through-hole IC's with modern SMD components
   which can be fully created by PCB assembly houses.

 - Drop in compatible with Combat cartridges. No cutting / drilling / gluing  required.

 - Micro SD Card uses standard FAT file format, so standard copy / drag-n-drop of files works.
   No longer requires separate utility to prepare card and playback no longer experiences
   random noise.

 - Supports both NTSC and PAL formats.

 - Enhanced video quality utilizing TIA background and playfield colors and
   optimized color space searches.

 - Enhanced audio encoding that utilizes error diffusion which introduces constant hiss, but
   eliminates random drop outs and distortion during low volume.

 - Encoding utility redesigned to be more intuitive.

 - Reliable startup, as boot time is now 0.58 msec from powerup.
   (Flashback 2 starts reading from the cart in 1.52 msec, while Atari 2600 around 25 msec).
