Updating content:

Your MovieCart should include an sd-card with full length movie on it.
Feel free to swap out the file with any other mvc file of your own.


NOTES:

Best performance is had when the sd-card is freshly formatted before placing the file, to make forwarding and
rewinding smoother.
When formatting an sd-card, it must be FAT32 format.

Please note MovieCart only supports a maximum file size of 4GB.
This translates to around 4 hours of content, so lots of room for most cases.

It only plays the first regular file it finds on the card, so if you have several videos, they must all be combined
before encoding into a single mvc file.

The files below are zipped for easier download, but they must be UNZIPPED before copying to the sd-card.

# George Romero's classic 1968 thriller, artificially colorized.  
night_dead_nov23.mvc

# Same as above but encoded for PAL format (50 Hz, Atari PAL color format, 242 lines)
