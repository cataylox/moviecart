Updating content:

Your MovieCart should include an sd-card with full length movie on it.
Feel free to put any mvc files on it, including your own.


NOTES:

Best performance is had when the sd-card is freshly formatted before placing the file,
to make forwarding and rewinding smoother.
When formatting an sd-card, it must be FAT32 format.

MovieCart  supports a maximum file size of 4GB.
This translates to around 4 hours of content, so lots of room for most cases.

Early MovieCarts only play the first regular file it finds on the card, so if you have several videos,
they must all be combined before encoding into a single mvc file, or you can update it with the latest
upgrades, including use of the select button to switch between video files.

The files below are zipped for easier download, but they must be UNZIPPED before copying to the sd-card.

# George Romero's classic 1968 thriller, artificially colorized.
