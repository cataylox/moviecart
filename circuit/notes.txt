Still too narrow on some production runs, as drill tolerance varies.
Try increasing slightly.

special sdcard access version for injection molded offerings:
 -consider moving sd card further to edge to increase access on slotted cart.
   even widen entire top half left/right to reach edge.
 -deepen side tabs toward center to fit
 -consider shortening center post hole to match?
 -consider a double tab piece that glues through rectangular slots for stability.

consider:
  tactile switch to burn/factory reset firmware updates, instead of grounding programming pins
