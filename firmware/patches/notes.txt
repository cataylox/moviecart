** ONLY DO THIS IF ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY AS YOU RISK BRICKING THE MOVIECART **

INSTALLING A NEW PATCH:

Note: Installing a patch will replace any existing patches, so make sure you have the latest.
Select the update.frm file you require and place it on an sd-card by itself with no other files.
Insert it into the Moviecart, and insert the MovieCart into the Atari console.
Power up the Atari.
It should only take a few seconds to update.
If successfully updated, the LED will flash 22..22..22..
If unsuccessful it will flash 33..33..33..
Turn off the Atari and remove the MovieCart PCB.

FACTORY RESET (Remove a patches) :
* NOTE *  Only some patches are removable, some are permanent.
Please read the notes associated with each patch before applying.

If a patch needs to be removed, use a thin wire with both ends exposed.
A metallic sandwich twist tie, with the paper removed from each end works well.

Remove any SD cards from the MovieCart PCB.
Insert one end through the hole labelled 'PGD' and the other through the hole labelled 'GND'.
These are holes 2 and 3 of a five hole section in the upper left hand side of the MovieCart PCB.
Verify they are labelled 'PGD' and 'GND'.
Verify the ends of the wire aren't making contact with any other points on the PCB.

Insert the MovieCart PCB (with the wire in place) into the Atari, and power up the Atari.
After factory reset, it will flash 22..22..22..
Turn off the Atari and remove the wire.
It should now power up as originally delivered.
